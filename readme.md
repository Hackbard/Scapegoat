## ABOUT SCAPEGOAT

* the theme is made for the [Piratenpartei Berlin](http://berlin.piratenpartei.de/)
* the default slider images and the 404 image are taken by [Ben de Biel](http://www.bendebiel.com/)
* the font "PoliticsHeadBold" is made by [Fred Bordfeld](http://kaklotter.de/)

## HOW TO

*Slider Image Size ```1440x486```
*Post Image Size ```720x243```
* first of all, you have to insert some informations about yourself in your profile-section
* use custom menues and insert the start-page to the main-menu, if you want to display the home icon in your header menu
* use widgets for the sidebar and footer. The footer looks best with 4 Widgets with approximately equal heights. Don't use menu widgets in the footer, there is a separate footer-menu
* take a look at the theme-options and improve your front-page with it
* give your categories a description! You can use html-tags there as well and also images with caption. Insert your this at the Top of the Description. It will be cut by jQuery and append to the right place automatically:
```<img src=" + image url + " /> <span class="meta-thumbnail-caption"> + caption + </span>```
* Firefox on Windows don't load the fonts of the theme. To fix that, you have to insert this on top of your **.htaccess**:
```<FilesMatch "\.(ttf|otf|eot|woff|svg)$">Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"</FilesMatch>```
